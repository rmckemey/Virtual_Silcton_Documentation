# Data Analysis Tips and Scripts

The analysis github repository contains the available code for coding and analyzing some of the website data. Hopefully this capacity will be increased over time. 

## Onsite Pointing data

For canonical analyses, the onsite pointing data can be aggregated within participant and different/same route judgments. 

## Navigation Logs

Navigation log data are text files for each route the participant experienced. 

These data have the following properties: 

They begin 5 seconds into each route. 
They record position and facing direction with the resolution of 10Hz. 
Each position vector is: [x,y,z,theta]. y-values stay the same through the route because the participant does not move vertically. 

Theta = 0 is a vector pointing "Up" on the Virtual Silcton map. 

The corners of the map are defined with the coordinates: 
  Lower left:  [-750, Y, -700]
  Lower right: [700, Y, -700]
  Upper left:  [-750, Y, 300]
  Upper right: [700, Y, 300]

## Model Building Tasks

The model building task data can be downloaded and analyzed using the scripts found in the /ModelBuilding directory of the [Analysis git repo](https://github.com/smweis/Virtual_Silcton_Analysis)
