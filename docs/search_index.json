Weisberg, PhD 02 February, 2021 Section 1 Virtual Silcton Introduction Welcome to the documentation for Virtual Silcton. The Virtual Silcton environment was originally designed in Unity3D by Victor Schinazi and Drew Dara-Abrams. In 2012, Steven Weisberg began updating and maintaining the documentation and website for administration of the Virtual Silcton environment. This documentation was drafted by Steven M. Weisberg and last edited on the date at the top of this page. Virtual Silcton Image 1.1 Important Links The Virtual Silcton website is available for use. Please email stevenweisberg@ufl.edu to setup an experimenter account and receive information about testing. The Virtual Silcton materials are available offline for download at the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/fykr7/ There, you will also be able to find analysis tools and an explainer for the bug, once one is available.

This documentation provides basic instructions, best practices, and documentation of experimental protocols and some data processing. The Virtual Silcton environment was initially developed by Victor R. Schinazi and Drew Dara-Abrams in a collaboration funded by the NSF as part of the Spatial Intelligence and Learning Center. Nora Newcombe and Russell Epstein spear-headed the initial project development until 2012, including developing the original 3D Unity files and placing the entire experiment on a website. Since 2012, Steven Weisberg has been responsible for maintaining and updating the Virtual Silcton platform. In 2019, the firm Gaia Solutions took over the web development side. Virtual Silcton has been designed with the idea of creating a semi-customizable but largely standard 3D virtual environment measure of navigation behavior. Silcton trades off flexibility for stability. Although not all experimental designs are possible, this means that most studies which use Silcton are comparable because all participants experience largely the same environment, in mostly the same order, and are assessed the same way. 2.1 Real World Ambler Campus The Virtual Silcton environment is built as a virtual replica of Temples Ambler campus outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In that suburban college campus, Victor Schinazi and colleagues ran approximately 15 subjects through a real-world version of the Silcton experiment in three sessions. Among their findings, it was evident that subjects had wide variability for learning the environment successfully over time. It was time to scale up. 2.2 Virtual Silcton studies The initial Virtual Silcton experiments were designed to measure individual differences in spatial navigation behavior objectively and see if individual variability could be correlated with other measures of cognitive traits. These experiments (including Weisberg et al., 2013 and Weisberg &amp; Newcombe (2016)), revealed substantial variation in performance across people. Although performance on Silcton was correlated with a self-report measure of navigation behavior (the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale), unique variance was explained by measures like the mental rotation test and working memory measures. Beyond the initial experiments, a large number of labs and experimenters have used the Virtual Silcton software to measure individual differences in spatial navigation behavior.

To begin, you need to set up an account. Email Steven Weisberg stevenweisberg at ufl dot edu using an institutional email and provide a current CV. You will receive instructions for how to login. 3.1 A note about IRB Approval Temple University maintains an omnibus IRB protocol, which covers administrative access to the Virtual Silcton website. Steven Weisberg, Nora Newcombe, web developers in our employment will have access to data collected from all Labs. THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU DO NOT NEED YOUR OWN IRB APPROVAL. To run your own study, you are required to provide informed consent at follow all protocols under a separate IRB from your home institution. Steven Weisberg and Nora Newcombe do not manage or maintain this information. 3.2 Setting up an Account The link you receive will send you to the Silcton Splash page: Virtual Silcton Splash Page The links on the left will route participants to the studies that are visible on the website. The link on the right, Manage Studies, will take you to the experimenter interface. The administrator has created a Lab for you, which you can log into. The Virtual Silcton Website is broken up into Labs, which are only accessible to Administrators (Steven Weisberg, Nora Newcombe, web developers) and Lab-specific personnel. In your lab, only the people whose accounts you set up will have access to your studies and data. 3.3 Labs Labs are the main partition of the Virtual Silcton Website. Each Lab has the capability of creating studies, administering studies, and managing their own data. No other labs have access to your data. 3.4 Studies A Study is a data collection partition within a lab. All participants collected via one Study will be affiliated together throughout the Experimenter Interface. Studies can be customized in various ways (See Building Studies.) Clicking on the Studies tab of the Experimenter Interface displays all Studies your lab has created, along with some meta-data about the Study. Virtual Silcton Studies 3.5 Account Types 3.5.1 Experimenters For the lab they belong to: 1. Can view materials, participants, and data from the Experimenter Interface. 2. Can edit Studies and delete Participants for Studies which they have been assigned Primary Experimenter. For all labs: 3. View publicly-available data. (See Studies). 3.6 Lab Managers Have all the capabilities of Experimenters, PLUS: For the lab they belong to: 1. Can delete participants. 2. Can view all lab data. 3. Can add, edit, and delete Lab Managers, Experimenters, and Studies. 3.7 Administrators Have all the capabilities of Lab Managers, PLUS: For all labs: 1. Can delete participants. 2. Can add, edit, and delete Studies. 3. Can add, edit, and delete Administrators.

Scrolling to the bottom of this list, youll find a Create Study button. Clicking this will create a new Study. 4.2 Edit Study When you first create a study (or, if you click Edit Study for a study youve already created), you will be able to customize it with the following options: Name: How your study will be referenced throughout the Silcton website. Lab: The lab the study is affiliated with. (Note, if you choose a lab you are not affiliated with, you will not have access to the data collected from it.) Primary Experimenter: The experimenter in charge of editing the study. (Note, Lab Managers will still be able to edit participants and studies for their lab. If an Experimenter is assigned this role, they will have these capabilities only for this Study). Active: If checked, the Study will be viewable by any visitor to the main web page. ONLY CHECK THIS FOR STUDIES YOU HAVE IRB APPROVAL TO RECRUIT AND COLLECT DATA FOR ANYONE WHO FINDS THE WEBSITE Ask for participant ID? (DEPRECATED - no custom IDs are possible.) When to Share Data: All data collected via the Virtual Silcton repository will be made public after a 3-year embargo period for Participants who agree to the Web Data Release. The experimenter has the option to make data public immediately rather than waiting 3-years. Public data are made available to all Virtual Silcton website users. Instruments: The dropdown menu provides all instruments available through Virtual Silcton. See Silcton Measures and Other Measures. Welcome Text: Text entered here will appear on the first page the participant sees. (HTML Tags can be used in this field.) Completion Text: Text entered here will appear after the final instrument is completed. (HTML Tags can be used in this field.)
